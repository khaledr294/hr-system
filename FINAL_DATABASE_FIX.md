# ðŸš¨ FINAL FIX: Get Valid Prisma Accelerate URL

## The Issue
Your current Prisma Accelerate API key is invalid/expired. We need a fresh connection string.

## STEPS TO FIX (Do this NOW):

### 1. Go to Prisma Console
- Open: https://console.prisma.io/
- Login to your account

### 2. Find Your Database
- Look for your **saed-hr-system** database (the one with actual data)
- Click on it to open

### 3. Get Connection String
- Look for "Connection String" or "Database URL" section
- You'll see two options:
  - **Prisma Accelerate URL** (starts with `prisma://`)
  - **Direct PostgreSQL URL** (starts with `postgresql://`)

### 4. Copy the PRISMA ACCELERATE URL
- It should look like: `prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=NEW_VALID_API_KEY`
- Make sure it's the **Accelerate** version, not the direct PostgreSQL one

### 5. Update Both Local and GitHub
**Update Local .env:**
```
DATABASE_URL="prisma://accelerate.prisma-data.net/?api_key=YOUR_NEW_VALID_API_KEY"
```

**Update GitHub Secret:**
- Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hr-system/settings/secrets/actions
- Update `DATABASE_URL` secret with the same value

### 6. Test Connection
After updating both, we'll test the connection and deploy.

## What Went Wrong Before?
- We were using an old/invalid API key
- The `prisma+postgres://` format was wrong (should be just `prisma://`)
- Need fresh credentials from Prisma Console

## Next Steps
1. Get the new connection string from Prisma Console
2. Update both .env and GitHub secret
3. Test locally
4. Deploy successfully

**Copy the new connection string and paste it here when ready!**
